# Mixed-Versus-Random-Effects-When-To-Use
To perform a meta-analysis and subgroup analysis using a mixed effects model in R, you can use the metafor package. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to do this:
# Load the metafor package
library(metafor)

# Load the dataset
data(dataset_name)

# Define the outcome variable and the variables for the subgroup analysis
outcome <- "outcome_variable"
subgroup_variable <- "subgroup_variable"

# Compute the effect sizes for the studies
dat <- escalc(measure="SMD", m1i=m1, sd1i=sd1, n1i=n1, m2i=m2, sd2i=sd2, n2i=n2, data=dataset_name)

# Set up the mixed effects model for the meta-analysis
mixed_model <- rma.mv(yi, vi, random = ~ 1 | study, data = dat)

# Print the results of the meta-analysis
summary(mixed_model)

# Conduct a subgroup analysis using the mixed effects model
subgroup_model <- rma.mv(yi, vi, mods = ~ subgroup_variable, random = ~ 1 | study, data = dat)

# Print the results of the subgroup analysis
summary(subgroup_model)

# Load the metafor package
library(metafor)

# Load the dataset
data(dat.bcg)

# Define the outcome variable and the grouping variable
outcome <- "logrisk"
group <- "alloc"

# Create a meta-analysis object with a random effects model
ma <- rma(yi = logrisk, vi = se^2, data = dat.bcg, method = "REML")

# Print the results
summary(ma)

# Load the dataset
data(dat.bcg)

# Define the outcome variable and the grouping variable
outcome <- "logrisk"
group <- "alloc"

# Create a meta-analysis object with a random effects model
ma <- rma(yi = logrisk, vi = se^2, data = dat.bcg, method = "REML")

# Print the results
summary(ma)


Deciding whether to use a mixed effects model or a random effects model for a meta-analysis can depend on several factors. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

Heterogeneity: One of the key differences between mixed effects and random effects models is how they handle heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies. If there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes, a random effects model may be more appropriate since it assumes that the true effect sizes may vary across studies due to differences in study characteristics or other factors. On the other hand, if there is little or no heterogeneity in the effect sizes, a mixed effects model may be sufficient since it assumes that the true effect sizes are fixed and only the sampling error varies across studies.
Study design: Another factor to consider is the design of the studies included in the meta-analysis. If the studies are primarily randomized controlled trials with similar designs and populations, a mixed effects model may be more appropriate since it assumes that the effect sizes are fixed and only the sampling error varies. However, if the studies are more diverse in terms of their design and populations, a random effects model may be more appropriate since it allows for more flexibility in the true effect sizes across studies.
Sample size: The sample size of the studies included in the meta-analysis can also influence the choice between mixed and random effects models. If the studies are relatively small, a random effects model may be more appropriate since it can provide more conservative estimates of the true effect size and account for potential differences in the true effect size across studies. However, if the studies are relatively large, a mixed effects model may be sufficient since the sampling error is likely to be small relative to the true effect size.
Research question: Finally, the research question and goals of the meta-analysis can also influence the choice between mixed and random effects models. If the goal is to estimate an overall effect size for a specific population or intervention, a mixed effects model may be more appropriate since it assumes that the true effect size is fixed and provides a more precise estimate. However, if the goal is to explore potential sources of heterogeneity or variability in the effect sizes across studies, a random effects model may be more appropriate since it allows for more flexibility in the true effect sizes across studies.

Define the outcome variable logrisk and the grouping variable alloc (which specifies the allocation method of each study).

Next, we create a meta-analysis object using the rma function with the method = "REML" argument to specify a random effects model. We provide the yi argument as the outcome variable, vi as the variance of the outcome variable, and data as the dataset.

We then print the results using the summary function, which provides information about the overall effect size, heterogeneity, and other statistics.

To perform a subgroup analysis, we create another meta-analysis object using the rma function, but this time we include the mods argument to specify the grouping variable. In this case, we group the studies by their allocation method (alloc). We again print the results using the summary function.
